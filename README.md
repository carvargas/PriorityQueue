# PriorityQueue

Simulation of a priority queue using arrays.

Takes in a JSON array of arrays with commands (enqueue or dequeue), jobs with priority numbers (for enqueue), or just a priority number (for dequeue). It "pops" or "pushes" jobs based on commands given and outputs the final state of the queue in JSON.
